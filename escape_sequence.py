# Escape Sequence
# Some of escape sequence include: \, \n, \t
# \t is used to tab
# \n is used to make new line
# What if we need to use single quotes and double quotes in our statements?

# The \ is used to escape sequence in order to tell python whatever comes after this is a stirng
taste = 'It\'s sweet' # the escape sequence character saves the day

# Another Example
print("Today's weather is very \"hot\"") 

# what if we wanted to print the back slash?
print("this is a back slash \\") # python takes the first slash to know the next character is a string
