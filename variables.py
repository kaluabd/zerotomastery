# variables store information that is used in our program
# some properties and best use of variables

#   snake_case  ---- makes it easy to read
#   Starts with lowercase or underscore
#   Letters, numbers, and underscores could be included in variable names
#   They are case sensetive
#   We dont wanna write key words ---- meaning we can not assign a variable name that already mean something in python (like print)
#   Name them what they meant ---- meaning make for other readers easy to understand

# When we want to store constantnts, we may use a convention of using capital letters to tell other developers('this variable is a constant')
# example:

PI = (3.14)
print(PI) 


# let just say we are storing our height in a variable and printing it

my_height = 185
print(my_height)


# dunder variables are those which start with double underscore(__) ---- they are to be left alone
